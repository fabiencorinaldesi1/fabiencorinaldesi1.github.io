I am Fabien Corinaldesi, PhD student at the laboratoire CRIStAL at Université de Lille. My supervisors are François Boulier, Florent Bréhard and Adrien Poteaux.

The goal of my PhD thesis is to treat singularities of algebraic curves using symbolic-numeric methods and validated numerics, aiming at both efficiency and maximum reliability from algorithm design to implementation.
